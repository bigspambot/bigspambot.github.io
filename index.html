        <h3>Hi, My name is Charlie. I'm from Sheffield in the UK.</h3>
        <p>
        I graduated with a BSc in Applied Computing in 2007 but ended up leaving the UK to travel
         and became an English language teacher abroad for about 5 years and then in England from 2014-2022.<br><br>
        I used to enjoy teaching in classrooms but found back home it was hard to get jobs 
        given my lack of teaching qualifications.
        I didn't want to have to commit to any more studies and was slowly falling out of love with teaching online.<br><br>
        So I eventually dedided to reignite my interest in computers and began coding in my free time - <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/byteMaster48428" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/charlie_b" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/supOurKid" target="_blank">Codewars</a> mainly.
        Before I knew it I was enrolled on a Level 3 Software Dev Bootcamp and enjoying the new challenges that brought.<br><br>
        I'm hoping to become a Junior Web/Software Developer and will be adding to this website to demonstrate my skills and personal projects.<br><br>
